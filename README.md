This repository demonstrates a common React bug: a memory leak caused by a missing cleanup function within a useEffect hook that uses setInterval.  The bug.js file contains the problematic code, while bugSolution.js provides the corrected version.  The issue arises when setInterval is used without a proper cleanup mechanism, leading to a continuously running interval even when the component unmounts. The solution involves using the return function within useEffect to clear the interval.
